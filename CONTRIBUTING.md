## Getting Started

1.  We use the [fork and pull][gh-fork-pull] model to manage changes. More information
    about [forking a repository][gh-fork] and [making a Pull Request][gh-pull].

2.  To build the lessons please install the [dependencies](#DEPENDENCIES).

2.  For our lessons,
    you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `master` branch.

3.  When editing lesson pages, you need only commit changes to the Markdown source files.

4.  If you're looking for things to work on,
    please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.

## Dependencies

To build the lessons locally, install the following:

1. [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md)

Install the Gitbook plugins:

```shell
$ gitbook install
```

Then (from the starterkit-lessons directory) build the pages and start a web server to host them:

```shell
$ gitbook serve
```
You can see your local version by using a web-browser to navigate to `http://localhost:4000` or wherever it says it's serving the book.
