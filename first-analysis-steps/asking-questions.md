Eventually you will get stuck when trying to do something.
This lesson is about how to get help with getting unstuck.

People love helping others. Below some tips on how to improve
your chances of getting a good answer. The answers you get
will depend very much on the way you ask your question.

{% callout "Mailing lists" %}
For LHCb specific questions your best bet are the LHCb mailing
lists like: 
[lhcb-distributed-analysis@cern.ch](mailto:lhcb-distributed-analysis@cern.ch),
[lhcb-davinci@cern.ch](mailto:lhcb-davinci@cern.ch),
and [lhcb-soft-talk@cern.ch](mailto:lhcb-soft-talk@cern.ch). 
A recent alternative to the mailing lists is the [Mattermost chat](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/lhcb) having dedicated channels ('davinci', 'Distributed Analysis' etc). It is a great place to ask your question if you're not confident enough to write an email to the mailing list, or you'd just prefer a more informal setting. 

For more general questions [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and
[Google](http://google.com) are good starting places.
{% endcallout %} 

{% callout "LHCb Q&A" %}
Another experimental alternative to the mailing lists is the [LHCb Questions and 
Answers website](https://lhcbqa.web.cern.ch/lhcbqa/).
It works like [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but focuses on LHCb-specific questions.
You can post your question there and you should usually receive an answer within a few hours or days.
{% endcallout %} 

The title/subject is the first thing people will see of your
question. If it is not interesting, they will not read the rest.
If you are struggling with a good title, write it last! Having
written the rest of your email will give you a better idea of what
the one sentence summary is.

{% callout "Grammar and spelling" %}
This is a no brainer. You want to make a good impression:
someone who made an effort and values other people's time.
If you aren't comfortable with writing in English, ask a friend
to proof-read your email for you.
{% endcallout %} 

Most people like hard problems and thought-provoking questions. So
give them an interesting question to chew on, and they will love it.

Despite this, mailing lists have a reputation for a hostile tone and
an air of arrogance. People are hostile towards people who seem unwilling
to think for themselves or did not do their homework before asking their
question.

{% callout "Volunteers" %}
Remember people are volunteering their time to help you. They have busy
lives and there are a lot of questions. So they filter ruthlessly. Make
sure your question is the most interesting one out there, and people
will choose to help you.
{% endcallout %} 

It is OK that you are not technically competent, what you need to show is
that you have the skills to become competent: alert, thoughtful, observant,
willing to be an active partner in developing a solution.

Before posting your question try:

1. [Searching the archives](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSearchForm.do) of the forum/mailing list
2. Searching the web
3. Finding the answer in a FAQ
4. Finding the answer by experimenting
5. Asking a skilled friend
6. Or reading the code

When asking your question, mention which of these steps you have tried. It
will help demonstrate that you are not lazy and put in some effort. If you
learned something from trying this, mention it!

The beginning of your email should explain what you are trying to do and
why, as well as where the problem occurs. Often it is useful to describe
the big goal, and not the particular step you are stuck with.

Help others reproduce your problem by including the necessary details. If
the problem is with code you wrote, include it. However do not post all of your
program. Try and make a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Stack
Overflow has a good guide on creating a [minimal, complete, and verifiable
example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

You have to be precise. Do not simply dump all possible information that
might be relevant. Vague questions receive vague answers. Being precise is
useful for at least three reasons. One: being seen to invest effort in simplifying
the question makes it more likely you'll get an answer, Two: simplifying
the question makes it more likely you'll get a useful answer. Three: In
the process of refining your bug report, you may develop a fix or workaround yourself.

When people post replies or questions about your problem, follow them up. If
you manage to solve your problem, tell the mailing list.

{% callout "Love letters also known as private replies" %}
Please do not reply to questions privately. We are trying to solve a technical
issue, not writing lover letters. If you take the discussion
off the mailing list future generations will just see the question and no
solution. You will also miss out on help from others that did not chime
in to your first question but might be able to help later on.
{% endcallout %} 

Once the problem is solved post a final message saying that the problem is
solved and what the solution is.
