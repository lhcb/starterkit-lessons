# The LHCb Starterkit lessons ![Build Status](https://github.com/lhcb/starterkit-lessons/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

These are the lessons historically taught during the [LHCb Starterkit][starterkit].
These lessons focus on LHCb software from Runs 1 and 2. For Run 3, the software changed a lot and a [new set of Starterkit lessons][run3-starterkit] was written.
If you'd like to join the next workshop, visit [the website][starterkit] to find out when that will how and how to sign up.

If you'd just like to learn about how to use the LHCb software, [read on](first-analysis-steps/README.md)!
