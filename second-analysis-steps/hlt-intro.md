# HLT intro

{% objectives "Learning Objectives" %}

* Getting started with writing your own trigger selection.
{% endobjectives %} 

The LHCb trigger reduces the input rate event rate of approximately 30 MHz
to 12.5 kHz of events that are written to offline tape storage. The rate
reduction is achieved in three steps: L0, HLT1 and HLT2. L0 is implemented in
custom FPGAs, has a fixed latency of 4 Î¼s and a maximum output rate of 1 MHz.
HLT stands for High Level Trigger.

HLT1 and HLT2 are implemented as software applications that run on the online
farm; HLT1 runs in real-time and writes events to the local harddrives of the
farm machines, while HLT2 uses the rest of the available CPU (100% when there is
no beam) to process the events written by HLT1. The evolution of the disk buffer is
shown in the figure below. Events accepted by HLT2 are sent to offline storage.

In Run I, both the reconstructions and selections used by HLT1, HLT2 and offline
were very different. In Run 2 the reconstructions used in HLT2 and offline are
identical, while selections might still be different. To be fast, HLT1 runs a subset
of the HLT2 reconstruction, for example HLT1 provides only tracks with PT > 500 MeV
and only Muon particle identification. We will see the difference in speed in the following. 

A new feature in Run 2 is the so-called Turbo stream. Since the reconstruction
available in HLT2 is the same as the offline reconstruction, physics analyses
can be done with the candidates created in HLT2. If a line is configured to be a
Turbo line, all information on the candidates that it selects is stored in the
raw event. The rest of the raw event, like sub-detector raw banks, is discarded,
and cannot be recovered offline. The advantage of the Turbo stream is that
less data are written to tape and no CPU intensive offline processing is needed.
The output of the Turbo stream is almost identical to the output of a Stripping 
line which goes to mdst.

The application of the software trigger is called Moore. Moore relies on the same
algorithms as are used in Brunel to run the reconstruction and in DaVinci to
select particle decays.

### Run Moore from settings

Let's start with a simple Moore script, we call it runMoore.py:

```python
from Configurables import Moore
# Define settings
Moore().ThresholdSettings = "Physics_pp_2018"
Moore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = True
Moore().Split = ''
# A bit more output
from Gaudi.Configuration import INFO
Moore().EnableTimer = True
#Moore().OutputLevel = INFO
# Input data
from PRConfig import TestFileDB
# The following call configures input data, database tags and data type
TestFileDB.test_file_db["2017NB_L0Filt0x1707"].run(configurable=Moore())
Moore().DataType = "2018"
# Override the TCK in the ThresholdSettings to match the input data
from Configurables import HltConf
HltConf().setProp("L0TCK", '0x1707')
# Remove a line which accepts every event when run on this sample
HltConf().RemoveHlt1Lines = ["Hlt1MBNoBias"]

Moore().EvtMax = 1000

from Configurables import HltMonitoringConf
HltMonitoringConf().OutputFile = "histos.root"

print Moore()
```

Try to run it with
```
$ lb-run Moore/prod gaudirun.py runMoore.py | tee log.txt
```

The property split defines if HLT1, HLT2 or both are run. In the example above both are run.
Change `Moore().Split` to `'Hlt1'` and rerun.
To run HLT2 only, you have to change some settings and the input file has to be a file where
HLT1 has run on:

```python
...
Moore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = False # Why?
Moore().Split = 'Hlt2'
...
TestFileDB.test_file_db["2017_Hlt1_0x11611709"].run(configurable=Moore())
HltConf().setProp("L0TCK", '0x1709')
...
```

Note: HLT2 needs to know about the decisions of trigger lines used in HLT1.
The decisions are decoded from the definitions in the HLT1 TCK. Therefore, HLT2 can only
read data which have been created when running Moore from TCK and not from settings.

{% challenge "Compare Hlt1 and Hlt2" %}
What is reduction factor of Hlt1? (Search how many events are accepted by `Hlt1Global`.)

What is reduction factor of Hlt2? (Search how many events are accepted by `Hlt2Global`.)

What is difference in run time of Hlt1 and Hlt2?
{% endchallenge %}

### Run Moore from TCK*

There are two ways to run Moore, from `ThresholdSettings` and from `TCK` (Trigger Configuration Key).
When you develop a trigger line, it is more convenient to run from ThresholdSettings. The TCK
is used when running the trigger on the online farm or in MC productions as it uniquely defines the settings.

{% callout "What is a TCK?" %}
The Trigger Configuration Key (TCK) stores the configuration of the HLT in a 
database.
All algorithms and their properties are defined in it.
The key is usually given as a hexadecimal number. The last 4 digits define the L0 TCK.
The first 4 digits define the HLT configuration. HLT1 TCKs start with 1, HLT2 TCKs start
with 2.
{% endcallout %}

Running from TCK has a few restrictions:
 1 The L0TCK defined in the TCK and the one in data have to match.
 2 The HltTCK might be incompatible with a Moore version if the properties of C++ algorithms changed.	

Here is an example script to run from an Hlt1 TCK.

```python
from Configurables import Moore
# Define settings
Moore().UseTCK = True
# You can check in TCKsh which TCKs exist and for which Moore versions they can be used.
Moore().InitialTCK = "0x117318A1"
Moore().Split = 'Hlt1'
Moore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = True
# In the online farm Moore checks if the TCK in data and the configuration are the same.
# Here we disable it as we run a different TCK.
Moore().CheckOdin = False
Moore().outputFile = "TestTCK1.mdf"
# A bit more output
from Gaudi.Configuration import INFO
Moore().EnableTimer = True
#Moore().OutputLevel = INFO
# Input data
from PRConfig import TestFileDB
TestFileDB.test_file_db["22017NB_L0Filt0x18A1"].run(configurable=Moore())
Moore().DataType = "2018"
Moore().EvtMax = 1000
print Moore()
```

Run with
```
$ lb-run Moore/v28r2 gaudirun.py runMoore_hlt1_tck.py | tee log_hlt1_tck.txt
```

To run HLT2 on the output data of the first stage, use the following script:

```python
from Configurables import Moore
# Define settings
Moore().UseTCK = True
Moore().InitialTCK = "0x217318A1"
Moore().DataType = "2018"
Moore().Split = 'Hlt2'
Moore().RemoveInputHltRawBanks = False
Moore().CheckOdin = False
Moore().EnableOutputStreaming = True
Moore().outputFile = "TestTCK2.mdf"
# A bit more output
from Gaudi.Configuration import INFO
Moore().EnableTimer = True
Moore().OutputLevel = INFO
# Input data
Moore().DDDBtag = 'dddb-20150724'
Moore().CondDBtag = 'cond-20170724'
Moore().inputFiles = ["TestTCK1.mdf"]
Moore().EvtMax = 100
```

### Exploring a TCK

If you are interested in how to create a TCK, you can follow the instructions
given [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/CreateSplitHltTCKs).

To get a list of all available TCKs one can use TCKsh which is a python shell with predefined
functions to explore TCKs, do

```
$ lb-run Moore/latest TCKsh
> listConfigurations()
```

There are other useful commands like `listHlt1Lines(<TCK>)` or `listHlt2Lines(<TCK>)`.
More advanced is to search for properties of a line. One example is to search for the prescale.
The prescale determines how often a line is executed, 1.0 means always, 0.0 never.
Type for example:

```
> listProperties(0x214a160f,".*Hlt2DiMuonJPsi.*","AcceptFraction")
...
> listProperties(0x214a160f,".*Hlt2DiMuonJPsiPreScaler.*","AcceptFraction")
```

{% challenge "Compare HLT1 lines from Run1 and Run2" %}
Try to find out which HLT1 lines were available in Run 1 and which are now available in Run 2.

What are the names of the topological trigger lines in Run 1 and Run 2?
{% endchallenge %}

### Write your own HLT2 trigger line or adapt an existing one

HLT2 lines are similar to stripping lines. They combine basic particles to composite objects
and you apply selections to get a clean sample. The framework in which you write a trigger
line looks different to a stripping line but the underlying algorithms are the same.
Documentation is found [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/LHCbTrigger#Developing_Hlt2_lines).
There you also find information how to measure the efficiency or the output rate of a trigger line.

HLT2 lines are found in the Hlt gitlab project in the package Hlt2Lines, see [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Hlt/tree/2018-patches/Hlt/Hlt2Lines/python/Hlt2Lines).

Their settings, i.e. the cut definitions, have to be defined in HltSettings package as well,
see [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Hlt/tree/2018-patches/Hlt/HltSettings/python/HltSettings).

As a hands on, we will change the prescale of a line with a high rate and then reduce its rate with extra cuts.
First setup a Moore lb-dev project from the nightlies.

```
$ lb-dev Moore/prod
$ cd MooreDev_prod
$ git lb-use Hlt
$ git lb-checkout Hlt/2018-patches Hlt/HltSettings
$ git lb-checkout Hlt/2018-patches Hlt/Hlt2Lines
$ make
```
Go to `Hlt/HltSettings/python/HltSettings/DiMuon/DiMuon_pp_2018.py`, search for prescale and change the prescale of `Hlt2DiMuonJPsi` to 1.0.
Run Moore again and see if the rate of this line has increased.

The line is defined in `Hlt/Hlt2Lines/python/Hlt2Lines/DiMuon/Lines.py`. The cut properties appear in the dictionary under `JPsi`.
Add an entry with the key `MinProbNN` and set some value. If you search for `JPsi` in the file, you will find that the lines
uses `JpsiFilter` from `Stages.py`. As it is used by another line as well, you have to add the entry to `JPsiHighPT` as well.
JpsiFilter simply uses muon pairs as input.  Go to Stages.py  and adapt the code of the `Hlt2ParticleFilter` to filter on the
pid of the muons, to do that add `(MINTREE('mu-' == ABSID, PROBNNmu) > %(MinProbNN)s )`
to the cut string. Run Moore again and see if the rate of this line has now decreased.

For more complicated developments which require changing many files or concurrent development of several people,
we encourage to use a full checkout of the `Moore` and `Hlt` projects and to use vanilla git commands.
A user friendly setup for this is being developed under the name [trigger-dev](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-HLT/trigger-dev).
We encourage people to check it out and give feedback on the [issues page](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-HLT/trigger-dev/issues).

{% challenge "Convert a stripping line to a Hlt2 line" %}
1. Pick a stripping line and convert it to a HLT2 line.
2. Make it a Turbo line (You have to set the property Turbo to true and the name of the line has to end with Turbo).
3. Run a rate test to determine the rate of the line, [instructions](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/MooreRateTestExamples) are found here.
