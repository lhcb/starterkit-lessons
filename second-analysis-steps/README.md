# Second Analysis Steps [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/second-analysis-steps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/second-analysis-steps)

These are the lessons for the second-stage workshop of the [Starterkit 
series][starterkit].
They build on those from [the first workshop](../first-analysis-steps), teaching 
LHCb software that's more advanced and more focused on specific tasks.

Unlike the first workshop, there may be some lessons here that aren't 
applicable to everyone's analysis, but all the lessons should still provide a 
useful insight in to how things work under the hood.
It may also be that some lessons don't depend on any others; the prerequisites 
will be clearly stated at the beginning of each lesson.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [open an 
issue][second-ana-issues] on the [GitHub repository where these lessons are 
developed][second-ana-repo], or you can [send an email to 
`lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).

{% prereq "Prerequisites" %}
Before starting, you should be familiar with the [first analysis 
steps](../first-analysis-steps) and satisfy all of its prerequisites.
