# Second Analysis Steps

These are the lessons for the second-stage workshop of the [Starterkit series][starterkit].
They build on those from [the first workshop](/first-analysis-steps/README), teaching LHCb software that's more advanced and more focused on specific tasks.

Unlike the first workshop, there may be some lessons here that aren't applicable to everyone's analysis, but all the lessons should still provide a useful insight in to how things work under the hood.
It may also be that some lessons don't depend on any others; the prerequisites will be clearly stated at the beginning of each lesson.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [open an issue][lessons-issues] on the [GitHub repository where these lessons are developed][lessons-repo], or you can [send an email to `lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).

{% prereq "Prerequisites" %}

Before starting, you should be familiar with the [first analysis steps](/first-analysis-steps/README) and satisfy all of its prerequisites.
