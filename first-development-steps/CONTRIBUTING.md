# Contributing

DevelopKit is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons,
fixes to existing material,
bug reports,
and reviews of proposed changes are all equally welcome.

By contributing,
you are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under
[these licenses][license].
You also agree to abide by our
[contributor code of conduct][conduct].

All lessons are based on the [Software Carpendry template](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example/), and are written in Markdown.

## Getting Started

1.  We use the [fork and pull][gh-fork-pull] model to manage changes. More information
    about [forking a repository][gh-fork] and [making a Pull Request][gh-pull].

2.  To build the lessons please install the [dependencies](#DEPENDENCIES).

2.  For our lessons,
    you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `master` branch.

3.  When editing lesson pages, you need only commit changes to the Markdown source files.

4.  If you're looking for things to work on,
    please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.

## Simple changes

1. Small changes can be made directly in the GitHub code editor. Click source to get to the GitHub repo.

2. Go to the page you want, in `_episodes`.

3. Click on the pencil icon, "Edit this file".

4. Make your changes.

5. At least fill in the change description, then propose file change.

## Dependencies

To build the lessons locally install the following:

1. [Install Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org/installing)

2. All Python packages required for lesson creation and validation can 
   be installed using:
   
    ~~~
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~~~
        
3. To convert Markdown files into HTML pages in the root directory, go
   into the root directory of your lesson and run:

   ~~~
   $ make preview
   ~~~

   You can run `make` on its own to get a list of other things it will
   do for you.

## Other Resources

1.  This lesson is based on the template found at
    [https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template).
    That repository has instructions on formatting and previewing lessons.

2.  For a list of helpful commands run `make` in this directory.
