# Git for LHCb

Most of LHCb's code has been moved to git using CERN's GitLab instance. There are two options for using git in LHCb. One is an "easy" method, which is provided with the intent to mimic the old SVN procedures. It provides the fastest builds when you are just working on one piece of LHCb software, but does not handle standard git workflows very well, making it difficult to use with larger projects.

The second method is using pure git; while it takes a little longer to setup and build, you'll be able to use git tools to manipulate branches, pull and push, and more; this is usually preferred by developers.
