## Topics

1.  [Using screen to keep things running](01-screen.html)
2.  [Topic Title 2](02-slug.html)

This is a rough list of the areas we would like to cover:

* Setting up your development environment
* Working with the repository
* First DecayTreeTuple on the grid (including screen, EOS storage, ...)
* Fun with LoKi functors
* (re/ab)using a stripping line
* Swapping mass hypotheses
* Decay tree fitter
* TIS, TOS and HLT
* Applying multivariate tools in DecayTreeTuple

Each area needs to be broken down into chunks of 10-15minute topics.
